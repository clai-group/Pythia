# Pythia Webapp README

## Development setup
Ensure you have docker installed on your machine (if on windows using WSL is recommended), and run this script to set up the development environment:
```bash
bash docker-shell.sh
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and edits to the code will be reflected live in the browser.

## Acknowledgments
Code for the webapp was adapted from https://github.com/rafiattrach/m3/tree/main/webapp.
